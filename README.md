# Purpose of the projects:
During Waterhackweek we will be facilitating open hacking sessions most of the afternoons. The purpose of these sessions is for you to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem related to geospatial sciences.

# What is hacking?
Hacking is a session of focused, highly collaborative computer programming, in which we create conditions for rapid absorption of new ideas and methods. Visit our hacking central page for more specific information on this approach.

# Why is this important?
Increasingly, research and software development is being conducted across groups of people with diverse skills and backgrounds. We believe this collaborative work leads to more innovative solutions to complex problems. At waterhack week, our goal is to explore with you some of the skills needed to navigate technical and social challenges of working in these kinds of collaborative settings.

# How will the projects be conducted?
On day 1 we will facilitate the sharing of ideas and formation of people into small teams (2-5 people)
each team will identify a:
## Project Lead
* Coordinate team in the direction of the research question pitch.  Data, code, and tools originally proposed may change.   Avoid dispensing and coordinating tasks.  
* Everyone should code something or get their hands on the data in their way.  
* The project scientist makes sure that their team all meet their individual goals, and that the team evolves.
* Pitch project.  Interact with all interested participants during networking. Coordinate team building with other instructors to an optimal size of 4-7 total participants.  
* Populate original GIthub project repository and readme following the Project Guidelines. 
* Coordinate with 1-2 Data Scientists to support your team, especially Github workflows that work for everyone to be able to contribute code. 
* Manage data.  Be sure you have permission and consent to use data you share in the project.  Follow professional standards while using data for training that may be used in  future publications.  Here is a good resource on publication of data and consent ethics. 

## Data Science Lead 
* Any group can ask any data scientist for help. 
* Interact with as many people as possible.
* Enable and encourage participants to solve their problems in a way that builds confidence in their skills
* Data scientists will be responsible for supporting at least one project, but expected to float around as needed.
    * Support for one project means that on Monday, the team’s data scientist should coordinate a Github workflow that works best for the       team by facilitating a team conversation. 
    * Mentor:  Remove personal/interpersonal roadblocks
    * Be in tune with progress toward individual goals (discrete daily personal brief checking)
    * Facilitate team changes
    * Technology Dam breaker: in a kind non-life threatening manner - what library or tool can this team use they may not know about?

## Team Participants

* Innovation is unpredictable!  Sensitive subject matter and personal physical boundaries may become an issue so find a process with your team to check-in regularly to address any issues to be aware of as a group.  If you find that you are not feel comfortable sharing with the Team, please reach out privately to discuss with an organizer or other instructor.   
* Be supportive!  Learning software and personal growth both require vulnerability and a safe space.  If anyone displays negative attitudes, judgments or insensitivity, we want to authentically address it.  If there are concerns outside of the scope you are comfortable addressing, speak with another leader about it or please contact Christina.  
* We aim to please.  Keep your instructors updated as to whether your learning and personal goals for the hackweek are being met.  If they aren’t, we will do everything we can to help you meet your goals.  
* Everyone at hackweek is primarily participating on a volunteer basis.  Please respect that this is a new community growing on donated time.  If resolution to any issue is beyond the scope of hackweek, we will direct you to more resources. 


once formed, each team will be guided through exercises to help narrow in on a set of tasks that are doable within the 5 days. A brief project outline will be posted to GitHub, following the "Project Guidelines" below.  Each morning will start with a daily stand-up meeting to check-in on progress and challenges. On day 3 we will have a mid-week project check-in. On day 5 each team will present their work in a series of lightning talks. 

## What can I do to prepare in advance?
if you have a project idea already brewing, we encourage you to share that with the team on our general Slack channel. We can add additional channels as the project ideas develop. Reel free to explore various projects and initiate conversations. The goal is to gather as much information as you can to inform your decision about which team to join when we meet in person.  Contact a waterhack organizer if you would like assistance in assessing whether a project is well-scoped, or if you need help with a particular dataset. 

## Where can I find help ?

### Instructor Tables
We have some tables where data scientists will congregate and participants can find any kind of support they need.

### Instructor Bios
We have the Instructor Bios and some sticky notes put up at one end of the room. This can be used to identify who is available and what they want to be asked about.  

### Project Help-Desk Data Scientists

By definition, anything could happen in a hackweek project! If you want it to happen faster, ask us for help. If you want help avoiding a downturn in productivity, teamwork, or creativity, we can help come up with ideas and solutions.

* Jacob Deppen - support data scientists, project scientists, instructors and organizers. 
* Madhavi Srinivasan- support participants, especially new code contributors on Github and Jupyter Notebooks
* Nicoleta Cristea - support on tutorials and almost every other question
* Christina Bandaragoda- celebrating surprises, wins and collecting data on what works; also, handles anything that is not working (questionable behavior, awkward situations, or code of conduct violations).

# HydroShare Guidelines

### What is HydroShare ?

HydroShare is CUAHSI's online collaboration environment for sharing data, models, and code.

Learn more about how to get started with HydroShare here : 
https://help.hydroshare.org/introduction-to-hydroshare/getting-started/

### Why put my data on HydroShare?

Data storage and limits: While code repositories like Github are optimized for version control and code publication, they have a strict file size limitation of 100 MB and total repository limit of 1GB.  HydroShare has a file size limit of 1 GB and each user receives automatically an allocation of 20 GB of space for their resources when they sign up. Users who need more space should contact help@cuahsi.org and explain who they are and why they need more space. 

Sharing: each file uploaded to Hydroshare receives a hyperlink that can be shared for easy download and data sharing, even with colleagues who are not HydroShare users. 

Publication: once your data is ready for formal publication, you can get a digital object identifier (DOI) for each HydroShare resource.

### What is a HydroShare resource ? How can I upload and publish a resource ?

In HydroShare, the content you upload and publish is referred to as a "resource". 

Learn more about how to upload and publish a resource here :

https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/

### What kind of metadata should I add for my resource ?

When you create a new resource, you will be taken to the landing page for that resource, where you can edit the metadata. You can also edit the metadata elements of your resource at any point after its creation by clicking on the “Edit Resource” button on the landing page. 

Learn more about how to describe your resource using different metadata elements :
https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/best-practices-for-describing-your-resource-with-metadata/

### What if I want to add custom/additional metadata for my resource ?

You can describe your resource using additional metadata elements beyond the default elements provided directly on the page. You can click on the plus icon next to “Additional Metadata”  and mention the name and value of the new metadata element.

### What if I have large number of resources or additional information about them ?

Sometimes, you may wish to add a detailed description of the contents of your resource, and it is inconvenient to type all of this text into the Abstract element or to include it as “Additional Metadata” elements.

One way to give detailed description of resource files is to include a README.txt or README.md file along with your resources. This README file can contain information related to but not restricted to:

* Organization of different resource files into a directory structure
* Description about the different attributes in the data resource(s). Additionally, one can add if the attribute is categorical or quantitative. If they are categorical and have been encoded, mention what each encoding means. For eg: 0 means female, 1 means male.

### How can I cite my resource ?

Citations include any institutes/universities/organizations that are to be credited for creating and collecting the data in this resource.
